    description: >
      One or more power modules are offline/not enabled/not communicating.
      Most common field fix is reseating after making safe. If the fault follows the module when swapped,
      it suggests a failed module. If it stays with the slot/system, suspect backplane/comms/controller/cooling.

    likely_causes:
      - Module not seated correctly (most common)
      - Backplane/comms connection issue at slot
      - Cooling-related shutdown (filters/fans/airflow)
      - Failed module (less common)

    safety_notes:
      - LOTO before cabinet access; wait minimum 5 minutes for DC bus discharge
      - Verify safe state before handling modules

    tools_required:
      - Multimeter (HV verification)
      - Insulated hand tools
      - Torch / inspection light

        *Kempower — Power Module Fault / Module Offline*

        One or more power modules are not communicating or not enabled.

        Common causes:
        • Module not seated correctly
        • Loose comms/backplane connector
        • Module disabled after transient fault
        • Cooling-related shutdown
        • Failed power module (least common)
