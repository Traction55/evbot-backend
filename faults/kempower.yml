      One or more Power Modules (PMC) or the Power Distribution Module (DPDM) is offline, missing, or failing
      self-check. This commonly causes derating (reduced kW) or makes the charger unavailable.

    safety_notes:
      - Follow site LOTO and Kempower safety procedures before cabinet access
      - Do not reseat or move modules unless authorised/trained
      - Do not re-energise if signs of damage or overheating are present

            *PMC Offline / Not communicating (RT_PMC_UNAVAILABLE)*
            Common causes:
            - seating / rear connector pins
            - 24V/AUX supply issue
            - module fault vs slot/backplane
