# EVBot Fault Pack: General DC Charger (All Brands) — On-site Technician v1 (Jan 2026)
#
# Purpose:
# - OEM-agnostic fault library for common DC fast charger issues across manufacturers
# - Node-based decision trees: decision_tree.start_node + decision_tree.nodes
#
# Compatible with EVBot index.js (Telegram):
# - Fault card shows response.telegram_markdown (preferred)
# - “Start troubleshooting” button appears when decision_tree exists
# - node.options MUST be a LIST of {label, next}

        🧰 **Will Not Power On (Dead / No Display)**  
        Quick triage before any invasive work.

        **Common causes**
        - Upstream supply off / breaker trip
        - E-Stop / safety interlock open
        - Control power (LV PSU) failure
        - Controller not booting
